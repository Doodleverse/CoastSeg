# How to Use the Shoreline Extraction Area

The shoreline extraction area is used to keep only the extracted shorelines within the region of the Shoreline Extraction Area.
You can draw multiple Shoreline Extraction Area polygons if your shoreline is complex or if you have multiple ROIs.

## Steps

1. Navigate to `Draw Controls` and click `Shoreline Extraction Area`
