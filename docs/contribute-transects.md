# Contributing Transects

## Prerequisites

1.Make your transects into a geojson file

2.Make sure your transects are facing the right direction

- Each transect should have its origin on land and its end point on the ocean

  3.Make sure each transect has a unique ID in its 'id' field

- Each transect should have its own unique ID in the 'id' field
- If you don't assign an id to each transect then run the cell in `add_new_transects_notebook.ipynb` to create a unique ID for each transect

## Adding the New Transects

1.Open `CoastSeg/notebooks/add_new_transects_notebook.ipynb`

2.Follow the instructions in the notebook to add the geojson file

3.Replace the csv in `CoastSeg/src/coastseg/bounding_boxes` with the new `transects_bounding_boxes.csv`

- `transects_bounding_boxes.csv` is generated by `CoastSeg/notebooks/add_new_transects_notebook.ipynb`

  4.Open a pull request

- State which region of the world the transect are for

- Provide a screenshot of the transects you are adding
